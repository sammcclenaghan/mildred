### Interactive Mode

Run Mildred in interactive mode:

```bash
ruby run.rb
```

Or with dry-run mode to safely test operations:

```bash
ruby run.rb --dry-run
```

### Script Mode

Run a file management script:

```bash
ruby run.rb path/to/script.txt
```

Example script (`examples/cleanup_script.txt`):
```
# Create organized directories
make directory Downloads/images
make directory Downloads/documents

# Move files to appropriate directories
move file *.jpg to images
move file *.pdf to documents

# Verify organization
list current directory
```

## Available Tools

### File Operations
- `navigate` - Change current directory
- `list` - List directory contents
- `move` - Move files or directories
- `copy` - Copy files or directories
- `remove` - Delete files or directories
- `make directory` - Create new directories

### Analysis Tools
- `analyze disk space` - Get storage usage statistics
- Search for files by pattern
- List directory contents with details

## Safety Features

- Dry run mode for testing operations
- Path validation to prevent accidental modifications
- Clear logging of all operations
- Error handling and reporting

## Writing Scripts

Create text files with one command per line. Use `#` for comments:

```
# Step 1: Create directories
make directory project
make directory project/src

# Step 2: Move files
move file *.rb to project/src

# Step 3: Verify
list current directory
```

## Example Scripts

Check the `examples/` directory for sample scripts:
- `cleanup_script.txt` - Organize downloads folder
- `organize_project.txt` - Set up project structure
- `test_paths.txt` - Test directory operations
