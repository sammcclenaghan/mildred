# Test script for path handling and directory navigation
# This script will test various directory operations

# First, let's see where we are
list current directory

# Create a test directory structure
make directory test_paths
make directory test_paths/subfolder1
make directory test_paths/subfolder2

# Navigate into the test directory
navigate to test_paths

# List contents to verify creation
list current directory

# Create some test files
copy file ../examples/cleanup_script.txt to ./test_copy.txt

# Navigate to subfolder
navigate to subfolder1
list current directory

# Go back up
navigate to ..
list current directory

# Try parent navigation
navigate to ..
list current directory

# Test disk space analysis at different levels
analyze disk space in .
analyze disk space in test_paths
analyze disk space in test_paths/subfolder1

# Clean up test directories
remove file test_paths/test_copy.txt
remove file test_paths/subfolder1
remove file test_paths/subfolder2
remove file test_paths

# Final verification
list current directory
